# ArduinoProMicroISP

## About

This is a fork of the ArduinoISP sample project to support using the common Pro Micro 32u4 boards (like [this](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640) from SparkFun) as an ISP programmer.

Compile this and download to a Pro Micro with 32u4 processor, then you can select Arduino as ISP in the Programmer menu.

## WIP!

Not working correctly yet.
